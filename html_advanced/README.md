An HTML element, also known as a tag, represents a specific part of a webpage's content. It is enclosed within angle brackets (< >) and typically has an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>). Elements define the structure and semantics of the content, such as headings (<h1>, <h2>), paragraphs (<p>), links (<a>), and images (<img>).

An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element. It is specified within the opening tag of an element and consists of a name and a value. Attributes modify or enhance the behavior, appearance, or functionality of an element. For example, the "src" attribute in the <img> tag specifies the image source URL.
