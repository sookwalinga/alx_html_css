The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree-like structure of objects, where each element, attribute, and text node can be accessed and manipulated using scripting languages like JavaScript.

## What is an element / tag?

An HTML element, also known as a tag, represents a specific part of a webpage's content. It is enclosed within angle brackets (< >) and typically has an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>). Elements define the structure and semantics of the content, such as headings (<h1>, <h2>), paragraphs (<p>), links (<a>), and images (<img>).

## What is an attribute?

An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element. It is specified within the opening tag of an element and consists of a name and a value. Attributes modify or enhance the behavior, appearance, or functionality of an element. For example, the "src" attribute in the <img> tag specifies the image source URL.

## How does the browser load a webpage?

When a browser loads a webpage, it follows a process known as rendering. First, it sends a request to the server for the webpage's resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.). Once received, the browser parses the HTML code to create the DOM tree. It then fetches and processes external resources like CSS and JavaScript. Finally, the browser renders and displays the webpage based on the instructions provided by the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
